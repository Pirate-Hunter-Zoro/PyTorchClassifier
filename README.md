# PyTorchClassifier

Within is a .ipynb file which utilizes PyTorch to create deep learning models. While certainly a work in progress, the ambition for this project is to achieve reasonable accuracy of a collection of colored images, and the file works such that you can specify how many classifications you want.

Disclaimer: The images are from ImageNet - I downloaded their "small" image population, and utilized only what was labelled as the training set. I randomly partitioned the training set into three different populations to create my own training set, my own test set, and my own validation set. I certainly do not take any credit for the creation of these images.
